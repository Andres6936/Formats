# Tricks

Comments are an extension introduced in the 89a specs. The 87 specs doesn't support comments.

A multi-frame GIF is not necessarily looping.

Looping is an unofficial application extension, "NETSCAPE2.0".

Many software skip frames with unusual duraction.

Loop is sometimes automatically added, for example by Twitter if the animation is shorter than 6 seconds.
